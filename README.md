# Functional-Programming-Exercises
This repository includes various exercises and experiments with the functional programming (FP) paradigm, as part of the software engineering trainee programme at Sogyo. These were used to deepen my personal understanding of the paradigm. Included is a function-oriented and recursive version of the game Nim, which I also programmed in Java.

The code was written in Scala, and also includes various unit tests to evaluate the functionality of the code.
