# Functional-Programming-Exercises
This repository includes various exercises and experiments with the functional programming (FP) paradigm, to deepen my personal understanding of the paradigm. Included is a function-oriented and recursive version of the game Nim, which I also programmed in Java.

The code was written in Scala, and also includes various unit tests to evaluate the functionality of the code.
